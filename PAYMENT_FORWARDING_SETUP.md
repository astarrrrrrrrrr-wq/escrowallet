Your escrow bot now supports automatic payment forwarding similar to C wallet functionality. Users can send USDT to unique addresses that automatically forward payments to your escrow wallet.

## Features Added

### ‚úÖ Automatic Address Generation
- Unique payment addresses for each deal
- Automatic forwarding to escrow wallet
- QR code generation for mobile wallets

### ‚úÖ Real-time Notifications

### ‚úÖ User Commands

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Crypto APIs Account (Optional)

1. Sign up at https://cryptoapis.io/
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add environment variable: `CRYPTO_APIS_KEY=your_api_key_here`

### Step 2: Configure Webhook Secret

Add environment variable for webhook security:
```
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secure_random_string_here
```

### Step 3: Update Replit App URL

In `main.py`, update line 2542:
```python
"callback_url": "https://YOUR-REPLIT-APP-NAME.replit.app/webhook/payment-received",
```

Replace `YOUR-REPLIT-APP-NAME` with your actual Replit app domain.
